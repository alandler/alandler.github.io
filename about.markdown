<h1>Anna Landler</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Anna. I am part of the MIT class of 2022, currently pursuing
a double major in Course 1 (Systems Engineering) and Course 6-3
(Computer Science and Engineering). I suppose one could say I enjoy engineering.</p>

<p>I am really quite new to this whole front-end development situation. I've worked
with a team to build colorfly.herokuapp.com, though honestly MAJOR shoutout to Ben 
who really took the reins on that one... I tried my best and intend to re learn React.
I worked in the MIT Transit lab to create a javascript-based tool that displays
at-risk areas of the T. Currently, I am working to develop a more integrated full stack
tool regarding traffic signaling and autonomous vehicles. Also, I am trying to build my
own web app that is a time tracking add on for Todoist.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time for said side projects, because Computer Science classes are
unerringly backend heavy and I just want to do ~cool~ and ~funky~ visualizations and tools.</p>

<p>Apart from hours of debugging and scouring documentation for new frontend tools I
run for the MIT varsity track and field team, play club soccer, and do a couple other
fun clubs like the Undergraduate Association Sustainability Subcommmittee and Hawaii Club...
even though I'm from Connecticut. </p>

<h3>PROJECTS</h3>
<p>Honestly, my favorite projects are simple little guys. Like using python to find the best value room on my floor to place my bid during rooming. Or creating a grocery budget spreadsheet that autofills price based on object and splits evenly with my roommate, with contingencies for if we are sharing or not, who paid the joint bill, etc. Or even my personal budgeting spreadsheet that is <b>way</b> more detailed than those Excel templates. </p> 
<p>But just wait until I convert my Todoist Time Tracker (name: Oversubscribed) to an MVC model using React and learn iOS dev for fun because THAT is a cool projet.</p>
<p>Also I've somehow done a lot of school projects (some solo, some teams):</p>
<ul>
<li>1.097- Created website that displays Boston parking data with stats.</li>
<li>1.057- Scaling gypsum arches and testing for load capacity.</li>
<li>1.101- prototype self-rising flood barriers.</li>
<li>1.102 - Modeling slime mold expansion.</li>
<li>6.009 - This entire class was endless labs/projects. Like writing the backend to the game "Bloons"</li>
<li>6.08 - Recreated Snapmaps basically.</li>
<li>11.S187 - Sadly cut short due to Covid-19, but was working to present insights from MIT's Recycling dataset.</li>
<li>15.053 - Formulated an optimization model to represent efficient distribution of solar cells in Sierra Leone.</li>
<li>MIT Transit Lab Research - Front end of tool that displays flood-prone areas of the T</li>
<li>MIT Wu Lab Research - Current! Full tool that displays relevant KPIs in different RL-based traffic control scenarios. Also with scenarios involving incorporation of autonomous vehicles into cities!</li>

<h3>GOALS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get better at PyTorch! Side project, perhaps?</li>
<li>Get better at D3! Incorporate into current research project and Todoist app.</li>
<li>Become a pennyboard queen</li>
<li>Relearn React. And understand webpack and babel.</li>
<li>Fiddle around with datasets...maybe ones with <i>trains</i>... pandas, numpy, seaborn...</li>
<li>Read "Educated" and finish reading "Anna Karenina"</li>
<li>Get a fall internship. So necessary. Honestly priority #1 </li>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>Flask --> Django. Higher learning curve doesn't scare me (ok, maybe a little)</li>
</ul>
