<h1>Anna Landler</h1>
<h3>Personal Website</h3>

<p> Hi! I'm Anna, a CS and Systems Engineering student at MIT. I spend my time running for MIT Track and Field (400m and 400H), completing PSets in everything from transportation modeling to software construction, and researching how autonomous vehices might affect system-level safety. I'm currently learning remotely from Utah.</p>

<p> I created this site mostly to learn how to use Jekyll, but I am periodically updating it with information on my academic, professional, and personal interests. It is certainly a work in progress. Thanks for visiting :) </p>
