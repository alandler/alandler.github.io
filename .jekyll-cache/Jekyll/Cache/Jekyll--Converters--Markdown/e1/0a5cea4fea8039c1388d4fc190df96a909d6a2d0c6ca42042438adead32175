<p>Thanks for popping in. This is very much a work in progress.
Arguably, I am even in the pre-progress phase. I'm glad I'm overcoming the
Jekyll learning curver though, rather than making a <b>normie</b> static bootstrap
HTML page.</p>

<p>I really hope to make this a functional portfolio at some point. It is
actually nontrivially difficult to find the time to work full time, maintain
~wellness~ and work on the things that would go in said portfolio. That being said,
I'm looking forward to getting some more <code>commits</code> up in here.</p>
