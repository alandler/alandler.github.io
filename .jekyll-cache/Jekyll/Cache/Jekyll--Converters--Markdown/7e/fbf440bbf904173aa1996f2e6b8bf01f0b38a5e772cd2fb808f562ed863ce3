<p>I was on a team of 3 that created a web app that enables users to login with a google account and create art. This was the project completed during the month-long January Term (IAP). By clicking the screen, you can create circles and lines of various sizes, colors, glows. These are stored using MongoDB. You can view the project <a href="https://colorfly.herokuapp.com">here</a></p>
