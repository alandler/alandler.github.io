I"c<h1>Anna Landler</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Anna. I am part of the MIT class of 2022, currently pursuing
a double major in Course 1 (Systems Engineering) and Course 6-3
(Computer Science and Engineering). I suppose one could say I enjoy engineering.</p>

<p>I am really quite new to this whole front-end development situation. I've worked
with a team to build colorfly.herokuapp.com, a javascript-based tool that displays
at-risk areas of the T. Currently, I am working to develop a more integrated full stack
tool regarding traffic signaling and autonomous vehicles. Also, I am trying to build my
own web app that is a time tracking add on for Todoist.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time for said side projects, because Computer Science classes are
unerringly backend heavy and I just want to do ~cool~ and ~funky~ visualizations and tools.</p>

<p>Apart from hours of debugging and scouring documentation for new frontend tools I
run for the MIT varsity track and field team, play club soccer, and do a couple other
fun clubs like the Undergraduate Association Sustainability Subcommmittee and Hawaii Club...
even though I'm from Connecticut. </p>

<h3>GOALS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get better at PyTorch! Side project, perhaps?</li>
<li>Get better at D3! Incorporate into current research project and Todoist app.</li>
<li>Become a pennyboard queen</li>
<li>Relearn React. And understand webpack and babel.</li>
<li>Fiddle around with datasets...maybe ones with <i>trains</i>... pandas, numpy, seaborn...</li>
<li>Read "Educated" and finish reading "Anna Karenina"</li>
<li>Get a fall internship. So necessary. Honestly priority #1 </li>
<li>AWS</li>
</ul>
