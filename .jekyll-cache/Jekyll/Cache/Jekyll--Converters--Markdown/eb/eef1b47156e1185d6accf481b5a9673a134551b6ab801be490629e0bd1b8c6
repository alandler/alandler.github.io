<p>For the final project of Civil and Environmental Engineering Design II, my team project involved creating an algorithm that mimicked slime mold. We used MATLAB to recreate pseudo-code found in our literature review, resulting in a slime-mold inspired, shortest-path algorithm. We applied this to maximize efficient vaccine distribution.</p>
