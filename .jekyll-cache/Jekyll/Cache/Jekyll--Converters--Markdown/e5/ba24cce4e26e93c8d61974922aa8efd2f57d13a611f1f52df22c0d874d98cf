<p>1.101, Civil and Environmental Design, was a hands-on lab class that culminated in a team project. My team designed, laser cut, and assembled a prototype of a self-rising flood barrier out of acrylic. We then tested the barrier in a wave flume, and performed analysis on slow-motion videos to determine effectiveness.</p>
