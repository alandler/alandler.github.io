## COVID-19 Image Diagonsis

My partner and I produced a final report for our class. This involved compiling a unique dataset from 2 data sources, and training a VGG network with Pytorch. We replicated competitive accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 (yes/no), and successfully classified chest X-rays into severity categories of severe, moderate, mild, and negative. We interpreted these diagnoses for practitioners using SHAP, highlighting pixels most important to the diagnosis.
