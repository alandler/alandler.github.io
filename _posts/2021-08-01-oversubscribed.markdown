## OverSubscribed

I am very interested in implementation science and productivity management. I have found that my current management of homework and other assignments, using Todoist, a simple todo list application, does not allow for refined time management. As such, I built a React web app that uses the Todoist API and my own flask API and sqlite database to allow me to better manage my time. It's a work in progress, but I have built from scratch the interface, with the necessary integrations. It highlights when a calendar day is over-booked. I intend to add more features and speed improvements.
