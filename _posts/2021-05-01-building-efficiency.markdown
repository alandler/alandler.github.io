## Efficiency Building Heating

For the most final project of my engineering sustainability class, my partner and I designed a small office building, under various constraints. This included selecting room dimensions, materials, and their thicknesses. The objective was to minimize energy needed to heat the building by calculating the thermal conductivity through all the surfaces. We ran simulations over a year based on real weather data, and also coded alternate simulations for a building with partially recycled airflow and multiple floors.
