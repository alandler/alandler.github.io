# Hi! I'm Anna Landler

I just graduated from MIT with a double major in course 1 (Civil and Environmental Engineering) and course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering). This summer I start full-time as a software engineer at Crusoe Energy. I'll take a break from work in the fall of 2022 to complete my M.Eng. at MIT in CS. My thesis project involves creation of a sector-coupled capacity expansion model for New England decarboniztion infrastructure.

## Projects

### School

- 1.00 - Created a website called "AirChef" that displayed real-time data and statistics from air sensors in my apartment.
- 1.013 - Programmed a simulation of long-haul EV trucking on the I-5 corridor that produces a set of metrics to evaluate the suitability of the charging infrastructure. From this, we used an algorithm to compute alterntive configurations that would improve these metrics.
- 1.097- Created website that displays Boston parking data with stats.
- 1.057- Scaling gypsum arches and testing for load capacity.
- 1.101- prototype self-rising flood barriers.
- 1.102 - Modeling slime mold expansion.
- 1.020 - Used MATLAB to model heat transfer in a floor plan of our own design in terms of area and materials. Developed a heating/cooling control scheme and ran simulations.
- 6.009 - This class focused on extensive labs/projects. One lab was writing the backend to the game "Bloons".
- 6.08 - Recreated Snapmaps basically.
- 6.695 - Wrote a final case study on the state of the electric power system in Ireland.
- 6.819 - Used VGG architecture to classify Covid-19 Chest X-Rays (positive/negative as well as negative/mild/moderate/severe). Interpreted with SHAP.
- 6.864 - Created a decade classifier for movies based on inputted conversations from scripts.
- 11.S187 - Sadly cut short due to Covid-19, but was working to present insights from MIT's Recycling dataset.
- 15.053 - Formulated an optimization model to represent efficient distribution of solar cells in Sierra Leone.

### Personal

*OverSubscribed*: This React web app (undeployed and private on my github at the moment) enables users to estimate the time required to complete various tasks. These tasks are imported via the Todoist API. User inputs estimates per task, and the app processes the hours and due dates. A calendar is displayed displaying the number of hours per day required to complete all the tasks by each of their due dates.

*Humming Game*: Currently a jupyter notebook that produces a list of 3 songs from 3 playlists, as well as an artist. I hope to find the time to make this an app that hits the Spotify API.
